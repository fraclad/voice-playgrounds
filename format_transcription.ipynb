But the main reason we did this at this time is the timing was driven by the fact that the acquisition of Crown Rock enabled us to establish the Midland Basin as a core area. Once we established Midland as a core area, we were able to build a good Barnett position based on some appraisal work we've done on the Barnett previously. So to get that Barnett. position there and to also then take that Barnett knowledge and apply it to the Barnett that's underneath our conventional assets on the Central Basin platform. All of that enhanced our portfolio of oil and gas opportunities to the point where we have now decades of development opportunity in oil and gas. So we wanted to look at ways to accelerate value to our shareholders and again start that return. turn of capital back to our shareholders. Now our portfolio is the best it's ever been and we're applying our advanced technology and processes to make it even better. So really what this is doing is bringing forward value to our shareholders but also enabling us to do what we do best which ultimately creates even more value for our shareholders.\"\n",

You had a $12 billion acquisition that you just mentioned with Crown Rock last year. That's a U.S. shale producer that you were able to build this position up. That follows a $55 billion acquisition of Anadarko, which is another Permian Basin play that you completed back in 2019. So that was a lot of debt. You've been paying it down. I believe your goal was to get to $15 billion by 2027. So you'll be getting there earlier, assuming that this deal closes. in this quarter as I think the release lays out you're anticipating it'll close in the fourth quarter all of those plays with the Permian Basin do you feel like shareholders have appreciated that if we're looking at a five-year stock chart you're up 390 percent but over the last year it's been a little rougher you're down by close to 10 percent\"\n"
