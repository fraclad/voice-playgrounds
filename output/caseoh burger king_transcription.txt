I mean I drive through a Burger King. Can I please get a waffle junior with onion rings? Make it a meal so I can get a drink. No I'm not finished that's not everything. Can I please get a double waffle but no cheese? Can I please get a number two with a large drink? I got money so I don't care how much it cost me. So you throw in some extra fries don't make em salty. All this cheese gonna make my booty drip drip. I'm lactose intolerant I don't sip hook. If I see a side of cheese I'm a trip trip. I'mma sit on your toilet seat and doodle the nip. So you got my lil waffle junior I didn't even forget that. And you got my double waffle I didn't even forget that. What about my onion ring? I put all you to sit back. Burger King ain't know me now cheese I don't want that. It don't get in hungry now I know you heard that. Waiting for my onion ring so I don't have to turn back. Burger King don't play with me yeah this is so trash. Yeah I get it in revenicles but yeah you deserve that. Bet it's a plane they just give me all of my food. Either I pay right now or leave the drive-thru. Give me the bag and then I took a bite of my food. There's cheese in my mouth. I'm in a drive-thru a Burger King. Man did you give me a waffle junior with a cheese? Made it your meal so yes I got my drink. But why they gonna put cheese on everything? They put cheese on my double waffle with no cheese. I'll be taking a number two in the morning. Hold on can I please be excused for a moment? The cheese already in my body booty party. I farted. Yo you can't be serious. It's just cheese. It's just cheese. Kessil.
